# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Docker Image CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build the Docker image
        env:
          USER: ${{ secrets.USER }}
          PASS: ${{ secrets.PASS }} 

        #run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      #- name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo $USER
          echo $PASS
          docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag prof5ss0r/dcm_ubuntu_dcmwebserver1
          docker login -u $USER -p $PASS
          docker push prof5ss0r/dcm_ubuntu_webserver1
